      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>My name is Aanand Aman, and I am a student at Seneca College. I am currently in the third semester.
        My interest in the computer sector has pushed me a mile further in increasing my enjoyment of studies and
        training.
        I was nine years old when I laid my hands on a computer. Since then my passion for computers and technology has
        kept
        growing. As a result, I chose computer science as a major at the high school level. Nepal provides limited
        knowledge
        in the field of computers and programming, which has made me explore options for studying abroad. By doing
        online research,
        I came across the Diploma program in <b>Computer Programming and Analysis</b> at <i>Seneca College</i>, Canada.
      </p>
      <p>As concerned with my educational qualification, I completed my Secondary Education Examination (SEE) from New
        English
        Secondary Boarding School, Janakpurdham achieving a GPA of 3.85. Then I did my higher secondary at Mithila
        Institute of Technology,
        Janakpurdham with a Science major where I achieved a CGPA of 3.57 in the Higher Secondary Education Board exam.
        During high school,
        I discovered my interest in Computer Science where I enjoyed acquiring new skills and information along with
        some programming
        languages like Python, C, C++, JavaScript, etc. After completing high school, I realized the importance of
        international exposure
        and its implications on my entire academic and practical knowledge, I decided to pursue further studies at
        <i>Seneca College</i> Canada,
        in <b>Computer Programming and Analysis</b>.
